I help maintain <a href="https://p2preview.github.io/#/bibliography" target="__blank">P2Preview</a> / <a href="https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/" target="__blank">BlockchainBib</a>, a curated online bibliography of blockchain related papers. 


## Overview
The Blocks & Chains Bibliography is an html export of peer-reviewed papers as well as eprints and pre-prints of this github archive, containing publications and various online resources in the field of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technologies, commonly referred to as "blockchains".
More information can be found on Github. Contributions to the project are welcome. 


This <a href="https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/" target="__blank">bibliography</a> was initated by Aljosha Judmayer from SBA Research in 2016. <a href="https://p2preview.github.io/#/bibliography" target="__blank">P2Preview</a>  provides a newer and more user friendly interface, but migration is still in progress.
